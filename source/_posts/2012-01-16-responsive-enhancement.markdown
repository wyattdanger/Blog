While in Belfast at [BuildConf](http://2011.buildconf.com), I attended a workshop on Responsive Enhancement taught by [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com). 

Forget what you know about web design. From now on, view web design as a union of [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) and [progressive enhancement](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement) with a ["mobile first"](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933) approach.

Remember that HTML is an inherently responsive medium, and that we web designers broke that once we applied a fixed width to a container element. In fact, the [first HTML document published to the Web](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) is responsive in the sense that it scales to whatever device you are using.

Don't make your web designs responsive, keep them responsive.

##### A Note on "Responsive"
Before we go on about what is "responsive", let's clarify that media queries are only one part of responsive design. 

- A flexible grid.
- Flexible images.
- Media queries.

### The browser is always variable.

Consider the range of devices with a Web browser: desktops, laptops, netbooks, tablets, smart phones, e-book readers, video game platforms, ... the list goes on. Is your website built in such a way that it can be accessed from all devices? Do you build for the lowest common denominator and then enhance with layout and interactions? That's right, *layout is an enhancement.*

Furthermore, bandwidth on mobile devices is limited,

#### Mobile First
You can't sprinkle media queries onto your existing website like magic dust. You have to shift thinking and design for mobile first. Start with a minimal mobile website and enhance it to the desktop experience.

#### Content First, Not Context First
Don't assume the user's context. Don't assume all mobile visitors only want to accomplish one specific task.

#### Speaking of Context
Design so that your users won't need to use [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) or  [other](http://www.readability.com/) [related](http://www.apple.com/mac/includes/builtin/safari_reader.html) [tools](http://readitlaterlist.com/) to comfortably read your page.

#### Overthought Navigation
Users goals are often overshadowed by bloated navigation. Consider the old school way of designing a web site, beginning with wireframes. The first thing designed is the header and navigation, exhaustively overdesigned and ....

Content first, navigation second.

#### Alternative to wireframes: Style Tiles
Consider mood and branding, not layout. Style tiles are about organizing colors, typography, and the overall feel of a website design. Here are some examples from [Samantha Warren's fantastic write-up on style tiles](http://badassideas.com/style-tiles-as-a-web-design-process-tool/): 

![Style Tile 1](/images/styletile.jpg)

![Style Tile 2](/images/styletile-2.jpg)

These tiles offer two different designs for the same project, without the time-consuming full-page layout work or overthought navigation. The best part about style tiles is that *you can go straight from the style tile into the browser to start designing.*
