Inspired by Seth Godin&rsquo;s [What Did You Ship in 2010](1) post, I&rsquo;ve reflected on 2010 and listed things I&rsquo;ve shipped or accomplished this year. 

<!-- more -->

1.  I started my first full-time job at [Medium][2], and worked with the fine folks there to put the following sites into the world:
    
    *   [River Street Architecture][3]
    *   [FSGBank][4]
    *   [Chattanooga FC][5]
    *   [VO5 Haircare][6]

2.  2010 also had some pro-bono projects for friends and local Chattanooga folks:
    
    *   Designed and launched the [UTC Art][7] Department website
    *   Built [Portfolio App][8] for Tyrick Christian
    *   Built [Portfolio App][9] for Nicholas Turner
    *   Worked with some fun people to launch [Main Street Bike Co-op][10] site

3.  In August I moved to Atlanta and started at [MailChimp][11], the best darn e-mail marketing company in the world. Some things done there so far include:
    
    *   [DesignLab Blog][12]
    *   [Shirt App][13]
    *   [Pizza Chart][14]
    *   And more exciting projects are to come.

Also some other things I&rsquo;m proud of, unrelated to work:

*   Moved to Atlanta
*   Adopted a new cat, Max
*   Celebrated two years with Laura
*   Ran my first half marathon
*   Bought my first car
*   Quit smoking (10 months in after 5 years)

And what would this be without a few resolutions?

*   Run a half marathon in February
*   Run a full marathon in April
*   Contribute more in open source
*   Broaden my knowledge of languages and programming
*   Produce solid work in my new job at MailChimp
