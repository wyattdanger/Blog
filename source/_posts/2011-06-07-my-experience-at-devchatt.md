I had the opportunity to present on front-end Web performance optimization at [DevChatt](http://devchatt.org/) this past weekend. It was a great small conference, with most panels covering topics related to front-end engineering or infrastructure.

<!-- more -->

Picking a topic was hard. This was my first conference speaking opportunity. After considering the work I've focused on in the past year, I decided that performance is something I've learned much about. 

My slides are available [here](http://wyattdanger.com/presentation.html) in HTML. To build the presentation I used [Landslide](https://github.com/n1k0/landslide), open-source software which parses a Markdown file and turns it into a full-featured HTML5 slideshow.

#### Presentation I saw 
- [Chris Rimondi](http://twitter.com/#!/crimondi) on IPV6
- [Timmy Willison](http://www.timmywillison.com/) of jQuery core on attr/prop in JQuery 1.6
- [Daniel Ryan](http://dryan.com) on CSS3 [(slides)](http://dryan.com/css3)
- [Donald Sayers](http://donaldsayers.com/) on [Paywall.me](http://paywallme.heroku.com/)
- [Mike Dirolf](http://dirolf.com/) on [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
